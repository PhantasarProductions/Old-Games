# Old Games

Here you can report bugs for older games that are no longer in active development. I placed this all in one issue tracker as I don't expect too many bugs to appear here any more.
The games you may report bugs for are:

- The Secrets of Dyrt
- Ballplay Genius
- Scyndi's Forest Quest

Published games for which I do not accept bug reports any more are:

- Power of the Rings II
- The Fairy Tale (original version)

This is basically I no longer have the framework in which these games are written, making fixing bugs impossible.

VERY IMPORTANT WHEN YOU REPORT BUGS:
1. Since this repository handles MULTIPLE GAMES (and it will only grow over time) ALWAYS make sure to mention WHICH game you are talking about.
2. And don't forget to mention your OS. It does not need to be OS dependent, but it can be.
